### Testing Strategy & Quality Assurance

For detailed testing strategy and implementation, see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md). Key testing areas:

1. Unit Testing (per component)
- Data Providers: Data fetching, validation, error handling
- Feature Computation: Accuracy, boundary conditions
- Feature Store: CRUD operations, data consistency
- Scoring Engine: Weight calculations, normalization
- API Layer: Endpoint functionality, error responses
- Scheduler: Job execution, timing accuracy

2. Integration Testing
- End-to-end data flow from ingestion to scoring
- API endpoints with live data
- Job scheduler with full pipeline execution
- Database and cache interactions

3. Performance Testing
- Load testing for batch operations
- Concurrency testing for parallel processing
- Resource usage under different loads
- Response time metrics

4. Quality Control Testing
- Data quality validation
- Feature computation accuracy
- Score consistency and bounds
- Model weight validation

5. System Testing
- Configuration management
- Error recovery and fallbacks
- Environment setup and tear down
- Service communication

6. Backtesting & Model Testing
- Strategy performance metrics
- Model training and validation
- Weight optimization
- Lookahead bias prevention

7. Monitoring & Alert Testing
- Alert trigger conditions
- Performance metric tracking
- Resource monitoring
- Data freshness checks
